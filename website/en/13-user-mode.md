In this chapter, we'll try running the application execution image we created in the previous chapter.

## Expanding the executable file

First, let's make some definitions necessary for expanding the execution image. To start with, we have the base address of the execution image (`USER_BASE`). This needs to match the starting address defined in `user.ld`.

For common executable file formats like ELF, the load address would be written in the file header (program header in the case of ELF). However, since our application's execution image in this book is a raw binary, we need to prepare it with a fixed value like this:

```c:kernel.h
#define USER_BASE 0x1000000
```

Next, let's define the symbols for the pointer to the execution image and the image size contained in `shell.bin.o`:

```c:kernel.c
extern char _binary_shell_bin_start[], _binary_shell_bin_size[];
```

Also, we'll add the process of mapping the execution image to the process's address space in the `create_process` function:

```c:kernel.c {1-3,5,11,20-26}
void user_entry(void) {
    PANIC("not yet implemented");
}

struct process *create_process(const void *image, size_t image_size) {
    /* omitted */

    *--sp = 0;                      // s3
    *--sp = 0;                      // s2
    *--sp = 0;                      // s1
    *--sp = 0;                      // s0
    *--sp = (uint32_t) user_entry;  // ra

    uint32_t *page_table = (uint32_t *) alloc_pages(1);

    // Map kernel pages.
    for (paddr_t paddr = (paddr_t) __kernel_base;
         paddr < (paddr_t) __free_ram_end; paddr += PAGE_SIZE)
        map_page(page_table, paddr, paddr, PAGE_R | PAGE_W | PAGE_X);

    // Map user (application) pages.
    for (uint32_t off = 0; off < image_size; off += PAGE_SIZE) {
        paddr_t page = alloc_pages(1);
        memcpy((void *) page, image + off, PAGE_SIZE);
        map_page(page_table, USER_BASE + off, page,
                 PAGE_U | PAGE_R | PAGE_W | PAGE_X);
    }
```

We've modified the `create_process` function to take the pointer to the execution image (`image`) and the image size (`image_size`) as arguments. It copies the execution image page by page for the specified size and maps it to user mode pages. Also, it sets the jump destination for the first context switch to `user_entry`. For now, we'll keep this as an empty function.

> [!WARNING]
>
> If you map the execution image directly without copying it, processes of the same application would end up sharing the same physical pages.

Lastly, we'll modify the caller of the `create_process` function and make it create a user process:

```c:kernel.c {8,12}
void kernel_main(void) {
    memset(__bss, 0, (size_t) __bss_end - (size_t) __bss);

    printf("\n\n");

    WRITE_CSR(stvec, (uint32_t) kernel_entry);

    idle_proc = create_process(NULL, 0);
    idle_proc->pid = -1; // idle
    current_proc = idle_proc;

    create_process(_binary_shell_bin_start, (size_t) _binary_shell_bin_size);

    yield();
    PANIC("switched to idle process");
}
```

Let's actually run it and check with the QEMU monitor if the execution image is mapped as expected.

> [!TIP]

> At this point, there's no process for transitioning to user mode yet, so the application won't run. For now, we're only checking if the execution image is correctly expanded.

```plain
(qemu) info mem
vaddr    paddr            size     attr
-------- ---------------- -------- -------
01000000 0000000080265000 00001000 rwxu---
01001000 0000000080267000 00010000 rwxu---
```

We can see that the physical address `0x80265000` is mapped to the virtual address `0x1000000` (`USER_BASE`). Let's take a look at the contents of this physical address. To display the contents of physical memory, we use the `xp` command:

```plain
(qemu) xp /32b 0x80265000
0000000080265000: 0x37 0x05 0x01 0x01 0x13 0x05 0x05 0x26
0000000080265008: 0x2a 0x81 0x19 0x20 0x29 0x20 0x00 0x00
0000000080265010: 0x01 0xa0 0x00 0x00 0x82 0x80 0x01 0xa0
0000000080265018: 0x09 0xca 0xaa 0x86 0x7d 0x16 0x13 0x87
```

It seems some data is present. If we check the contents of `shell.bin`, we can confirm that it indeed matches:

```plain
$ hexdump -C shell.bin | head
00000000  37 05 01 01 13 05 05 26  2a 81 19 20 29 20 00 00  |7......&*.. ) ..|

```

Since it's hard to understand in hexadecimal, let's use the `xp` command to disassemble the machine code in memory:

```plain
(qemu) xp /8i 0x80265000
0x80265000:  01010537          lui                     a0,16842752
0x80265004:  26050513          addi                    a0,a0,608
0x80265008:  812a              mv                      sp,a0
0x8026500a:  2019              jal                     ra,6                    # 0x80265010
0x8026500c:  2029              jal                     ra,10                   # 0x80265016
0x8026500e:  0000              illegal
0x80265010:  a001              j                       0                       # 0x80265010
0x80265012:  0000              illegal
```

It's calculates/fills the initial stack pointer value, and then calls two different functions. If we compare this with the disassembly results of `shell.elf`, we can confirm that it indeed matches. It seems the expansion has been successful:

```plain
$ llvm-objdump -d shell.elf | head -n20

shell.elf:      file format elf32-littleriscv

Disassembly of section .text:

01000000 <start>:
 1000000: 37 05 01 01   lui     a0, 4112
 1000004: 13 05 05 26   addi    a0, a0, 608
 1000008: 2a 81         mv      sp, a0
 100000a: 19 20         jal     0x1000010 <main>
 100000c: 29 20         jal     0x1000016 <exit>
 100000e: 00 00         unimp

01000010 <main>:
 1000010: 01 a0         j       0x1000010 <main>
 1000012: 00 00         unimp
```

## Transition to user mode

Now that we've successfully expanded the execution image, let's implement the final process. This is the "switching of CPU operation mode". The kernel operates in a privileged mode called S-Mode, but user programs operate in a non-privileged mode called U-Mode. Here's the implementation:

```c:kernel.h
#define SSTATUS_SPIE (1 << 5)
```

```c:kernel.c
// â†“ __attribute__((naked)) is very important!
__attribute__((naked)) void user_entry(void) {
    __asm__ __volatile__(
        "csrw sepc, %[sepc]\n"
        "csrw sstatus, %[sstatus]\n"
        "sret\n"
        :
        : [sepc] "r" (USER_BASE),
          [sstatus] "r" (SSTATUS_SPIE)
    );
}
```

The switch from S-Mode to U-Mode is done with the `sret` instruction. However, before changing the operation mode, we're making two preparations:

- Set the program counter for when transitioning to U-Mode in the `sepc` register.
- Set the `SPIE` bit in the `sstatus` register. Setting this enables interrupts when entering U-Mode, and the handler set in the `stvec` register will be called, similar to exceptions.

> [!TIP]
>
> In this book, we don't use interrupts but use polling instead, so it's not necessary to set the `SPIE` bit. However, there's no harm in enabling it, so we'll set it. It's better to be clear rather than silently ignoring interrupts.

## Try user mode!

Now let's try it. However, since `shell.c` just loops infinitely, we can't tell if it's working properly on the screen. Instead, let's take a look with the QEMU monitor.

```plain
(qemu) info registers

CPU#0
 V      =   0
 pc       01000010
```

Looking at the register dump, it seems to be continuously executing `0x1000010`. It appears to be working properly, but somehow it doesn't feel satisfying. So, let's see if we can observe behavior specific to U-Mode. We'll add one line to `shell.c`:

```c:shell.c {4}
#include "user.h"

void main(void) {
    *((volatile int *) 0x80200000) = 0x1234; // New!
    for (;;);
}
```

This `0x80200000` is a memory area used by the kernel that is mapped on the page table. However, since it's a "kernel page" where the `U` bit in the page table entry is not set, an exception (page fault) should occur.

An exception occurs as expected:

```plain
$ ./run.sh

PANIC: kernel.c:71: unexpected trap scause=0000000f, stval=80200000, sepc=0100001a
```

If we check the 15th exception (`0xf = 15`) in the specification, it corresponds to "Store/AMO page fault". It seems the expected exception is occurring. Also, if we look at the program counter at the time of the exception in the `sepc` register, it indeed points to the line we added to `shell.c`:

```plain
$ llvm-addr2line -e shell.elf 0x100001a
/Users/seiya/dev/os-from-scratch/shell.c:4
```

Congrats! You've successfully executed our first application!
