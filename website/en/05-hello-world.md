In the previous chapter, we successfully booted our first kernel. Although we could confirm this by reading the register dump, it still feels somewhat unsatisfactory. So this time, let's try to output a string from the kernel.

## Say "hello" to SBI

```c:kernel.c {1, 5-26, 29-32}
#include "kernel.h"

extern char __bss[], __bss_end[], __stack_top[];

struct sbiret sbi_call(long arg0, long arg1, long arg2, long arg3, long arg4,
                       long arg5, long fid, long eid) {
    register long a0 __asm__("a0") = arg0;
    register long a1 __asm__("a1") = arg1;
    register long a2 __asm__("a2") = arg2;
    register long a3 __asm__("a3") = arg3;
    register long a4 __asm__("a4") = arg4;
    register long a5 __asm__("a5") = arg5;
    register long a6 __asm__("a6") = fid;
    register long a7 __asm__("a7") = eid;

    __asm__ __volatile__("ecall"
                         : "=r"(a0), "=r"(a1)
                         : "r"(a0), "r"(a1), "r"(a2), "r"(a3), "r"(a4), "r"(a5),
                           "r"(a6), "r"(a7)
                         : "memory");
    return (struct sbiret){.error = a0, .value = a1};
}

void putchar(char ch) {
    sbi_call(ch, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 /* Console Putchar */);
}

void kernel_main(void) {
    const char *s = "\n\nHello World!\n";
    for (int i = 0; s[i] != '\0'; i++) {
        putchar(s[i]);
    }

    for (;;) {
        __asm__ __volatile__("wfi");
    }
}
```

In addition, let's create a new `kernel.h` file and define a structure to return the results of SBI processing.

```c:kernel.h
#pragma once

struct sbiret {
    long error;
    long value;
};
```

We've newly added the `sbi_call` function. This function is designed to call OpenSBI according to the SBI specification. The specific calling convention is as follows:

> **Chapter 3. Binary Encoding**
>
> All SBI functions share a single binary encoding, which facilitates the mixing of SBI extensions. The SBI specification follows the below calling convention.
>
> - An `ECALL` is used as the control transfer instruction between the supervisor and the SEE.
> - `a7` encodes the SBI extension ID (**EID**),
> - `a6` encodes the SBI function ID (**FID**) for a given extension ID encoded in `a7` for any SBI extension defined in or after SBI v0.2.
> - All registers except `a0` & `a1` must be preserved across an SBI call by the callee.
> - SBI functions must return a pair of values in `a0` and `a1`, with `a0` returning an error code. This is analogous to returning the C structure
>
> ```c
> struct sbiret {
>     long error;
>     long value;
> };
> ```
>
> -- "RISC-V Supervisor Binary Interface Specification" v2.0-rc1

> [!TIP]
>
> The statement in the calling convention that says "All registers except `a0` & `a1` must be preserved across an SBI call by the callee" means that "the callee (OpenSBI side) must not change the values of registers other than `a0` and `a1`". In other words, from the kernel's perspective, it is guaranteed that the values of registers from `a2` to `a7` will remain the same after the call.
>
> TIP: The opposite of callee (the called party) is caller (the calling party).

The `register` and `__asm__("register name")` used in each local variable declaration are instructions to the compiler to place values in specified registers. This is a common idiom that often appears in system call invocations (e.g., [Linux system call invocation process](https://git.musl-libc.org/cgit/musl/tree/arch/riscv64/syscall_arch.h)). Ideally, this should be specified in inline assembly, but since it's not possible in C language (more precisely, in GCC/clang proprietary extensions), this trick is often used.

After preparing the arguments, the `ecall` instruction is executed in inline assembly. When this is called, the CPU's execution mode switches from kernel mode (S-Mode) to OpenSBI mode (M-Mode), and OpenSBI's processing handler is invoked. When OpenSBI processing is complete, it switches back to kernel mode, and execution resumes from the line following the `ecall` instruction. Incidentally, the `ecall` instruction is also used when applications call the kernel (system calls). This instruction has the function of "calling the layer one level below."

To display characters, we use the following `Console Putchar` function.

> 5.2. Extension: Console Putchar (EID #0x01)
>
> ```c
>   long sbi_console_putchar(int ch)
> ```
>
> Write data present in ch to debug console.
>
> Unlike sbi_console_getchar(), this SBI call will block if there remain any pending characters to be transmitted or if the receiving terminal is not yet ready to receive the byte. However, if the console doesnâ€™t exist at all, then the character is thrown away.
>
> This SBI call returns 0 upon success or an implementation specific negative error code.
>
> -- "RISC-V Supervisor Binary Interface Specification" v2.0-rc1

`Console Putchar` is a function that outputs the character passed as an argument to the debug console. We'll use this function to output the string one character at a time.

Once the implementation is complete, let's run it using `run.sh`. If you see `Hello World!` displayed as shown below, it's a success.

```plain
$ ./run.sh
...

Hello World!
```

> [!TIP]
>
> When SBI is called, characters are displayed through the following process:
>
> 1. When the OS executes the `ecall` instruction, the CPU jumps to the M-mode trap handler (the `mtvec` register). This trap handler is set by OpenSBI during startup.
> 2. After saving registers and other necessary operations, the [trap handler written in C](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/opensbi/blob/0ad866067d7853683d88c10ea9269ae6001bcf6f/lib/sbi/sbi_trap.c#L263) is called.
> 3. Based on the `eid`, the [corresponding SBI processing function is called](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/opensbi/blob/0ad866067d7853683d88c10ea9269ae6001bcf6f/lib/sbi/sbi_ecall_legacy.c#L63C2-L65).
> 4. The [device driver](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/opensbi/blob/0ad866067d7853683d88c10ea9269ae6001bcf6f/lib/utils/serial/uart8250.c#L77) for the 8250 UART ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8250_UART)) sends the character to QEMU.
> 5. QEMU's 8250 UART emulation implementation receives the character and sends it to the standard output.
> 6. The terminal emulator displays the character.

## `printf` function

Finally, it's starting to feel like kernel development! Once we can display characters, the next thing we want is the `printf` function.

The `printf` function takes a format string as its first argument, and the values to be embedded in the format string as subsequent arguments. For example, `printf("1 + 2 = %d", 1 + 2)` will display `1 + 2 = 3`.

While the `printf` function included in the C standard library has a very rich set of features, let's implement a minimal version for now. Specifically, we'll implement a `printf` function that supports three format specifiers: `%d` (decimal), `%x` (hexadecimal), and `%s` (string).

Since we'll want to use the `printf` function in user applications in the future, we'll create a new file `common.c` for code that's shared between the kernel and userland, rather than putting it in `kernel.c`. Here's an overview of the `printf` function:

```c:common.c
#include "common.h"

void putchar(char ch);

void printf(const char *fmt, ...) {
    va_list vargs;
    va_start(vargs, fmt);

    while (*fmt) {
        if (*fmt == '%') {
            fmt++;
            switch (*fmt) {
                case '\0':
                    putchar('%');
                    goto end;
                case '%':
                    putchar('%');
                    break;
                case 's': {
                    const char *s = va_arg(vargs, const char *);
                    while (*s) {
                        putchar(*s);
                        s++;
                    }
                    break;
                }
                case 'd': {
                    int value = va_arg(vargs, int);
                    if (value < 0) {
                        putchar('-');
                        value = -value;
                    }

                    int divisor = 1;
                    while (value / divisor > 9)
                        divisor *= 10;

                    while (divisor > 0) {
                        putchar('0' + value / divisor);
                        value %= divisor;
                        divisor /= 10;
                    }

                    break;
                }
                case 'x': {
                    int value = va_arg(vargs, int);
                    for (int i = 7; i >= 0; i--) {
                        int nibble = (value >> (i * 4)) & 0xf;
                        putchar("0123456789abcdef"[nibble]);
                    }
                }
            }
        } else {
            putchar(*fmt);
        }

        fmt++;
    }

end:
    va_end(vargs);
}
```

It's surprisingly concise, isn't it? We go through the string character by character, and if we encounter a `%`, we look at the next character and perform the corresponding formatting operation. Characters other than `%` are output as is.

For decimal numbers, if `value` is negative, we first output a `-` and then assign its absolute value to `value`. Next, to find the most significant digit of `value`, we calculate "how many digits there are" and store it in `divisor`. Then, we use `divisor` to output the digits of `value` from the most significant to the least significant.

For hexadecimal numbers, we output from the most significant nibble (one hexadecimal digit, 4 bits) to the least significant. Here, `nibble` is an integer from 0 to 15, so we use it to index into the string `"0123456789abcdef"` to get the corresponding character.

`va_list` and related macros are defined in the C standard library's `<stdarg.h>`, but in this book, we'll prepare our own versions without relying on the standard library. Specifically, we'll define them in `common.h` as follows:

```c:common.h
#pragma once

#define va_list  __builtin_va_list
#define va_start __builtin_va_start
#define va_end   __builtin_va_end
#define va_arg   __builtin_va_arg

void printf(const char *fmt, ...);
```

We're simply defining these as aliases for the versions with `__builtin_` prefixed. Now, you might wonder who provides these `__builtin_` versions. They are actually provided by the compiler (clang) itself ([Reference: clang documentation](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LanguageExtensions.html#variadic-function-builtins)). The compiler will handle the rest appropriately, so we don't need to worry about it further.

Now we can use the `printf` function. Let's write some code in `kernel.c` that uses the `printf` function.

```c:kernel.c {2,5-6}
#include "kernel.h"
#include "common.h"

void kernel_main(void) {
    printf("\n\nHello %s\n", "World!");
    printf("1 + 2 = %d, %x\n", 1 + 2, 0x1234abcd);

    for (;;) {
        __asm__ __volatile__("wfi");
    }
}
```

Lastly, add `common.c` to the compilation targets:

```bash:run.sh {2}
$CC $CFLAGS -Wl,-Tkernel.ld -Wl,-Map=kernel.map -o kernel.elf \
    kernel.c common.c
```

Now, let's run `run.sh`. If you see `Hello World!` and `1 + 2 = 3, 1234abcd` displayed as shown below, it's a success:

```plain
$ ./run.sh

Hello World!
1 + 2 = 3, 1234abcd
```

With this, the powerful ally "printf debugging" has joined your toolkit!
